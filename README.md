
# Extracting the Impact on Median Real Estate Sale Prices Following a Hurricane.
This project represents a collaboration between General Assembly and New Light Technologies.

## Problem Statement:

During a disaster, it is important to model and estimate the potential or forecasted effect of the event, including the projected/forecasted damage.
Existing indicators of forecasted damage include number of structures within the affected area, number of people in the area, number of households, demographics of the impacted population, etc.
This project will add an additional indicator: It will compare how hurricanes do or do not impact median sale prices by zip code before and after the storm.

## Executive Summary
 
## Goal:
- Our team aims to provide an initial proof of concept for a potential web application using the Flask library for Python. This rudimentary web application will allow the user to input a zip code and see summary statistics for how median real estate prices were affected before and after a recent hurricane. 

## Limitations
- For this project we only used the top ~6000 zip codes by population, not the entire ~41000 exhaustive list of zip codes.

## Libraries Used

- To following libraries were used:
